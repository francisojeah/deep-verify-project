## Introduction

With the rise of deepfake technology, the spread of manipulated political media has become a significant concern. DeepVerify aims to provide a robust solution to detect such content, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models.

## Features

- **Image and Video Detection**: Supports deepfake detection for both images and videos.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple models to enhance accuracy.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger for integration and usage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS
- **Machine Learning Models**: XceptionNet, EfficientNet-B4, 3D ResNet, CNN-LSTM
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Package Management**: npm
- **Monorepo Management**: Turbo

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics) dataset for training and evaluation, which includes a comprehensive set of images and videos with manipulated and real content.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/francisojeah/deep-verify-project.git
   cd deep-verify
   ```

2. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd web-apps/frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd web-apps/backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Microservice setup:**
   ```bash
   cd web-apps/microservice
   docker build -t deepverify-microservice .
   ```

5. **Database setup:**
   Create a MongoDB instance and configure your `.env` file in the backend folder with the necessary database details.

   Example `.env` file:
   ```bash
   APP_NAME=DeepVerify
   APP_DESCRIPTION=DeepFake Detection in Political Media
   APP_SERVER_LISTEN_PORT=3000
   APP_SERVER_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0
   API_VERSION=v1
   GLOBAL_PREFIX=backend
   SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_TIME=3600
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@example.com
   SALT_ROUNDS=10
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/deepverify
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_secret
   ```

6. **Model setup:**
   ```bash
   cd models
   python training/train.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd web-apps/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd web-apps/backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. **Start the microservice:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 deepverify-microservice
   ```


## Model Development

### Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
```bash
cd models/data
python preprocess.py
```

### Training the Model

Train the model using the training script:
```bash
cd models/training
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
cd models/evaluation
python evaluate.py
```

## Production Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the FaceForensics++ dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Training the selected models on the dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and fine-tuning.
4. **Deployment**: Deploying the backend and model microservices.
5. **Integration**: Integrating the models with the frontend application.
